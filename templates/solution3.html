    <p>Hey there! Are you feeling frustrated and on edge lately? Are you quick to lash out or get into arguments? If so, you might be struggling with anger. But don't worry, you're not alone and there's help available.</p><br/>
    <!-- <h3>Depression</h3> -->
    <p>Anger is a normal emotion, but when it becomes intense and frequent, it can interfere with your relationships and daily life. But the good news is, there's a way to manage it and feel better.Just like anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, there are different levels of anger, and it's important to know where you stand so you can take the right steps to feel better. Let's take a look at the different levels:
    </p>
    
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>No Anger Issues:</b> 
            <br/>If you don't struggle with anger, then you're in the clear!

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Mild Anger Issues:</b> 
            <br/> Mild anger is like a light breeze. You might get irritated from time to time, but you're able to manage it and keep it from affecting your daily life. To feel better, try to identify and address the sources of stress in your life, practice relaxation techniques, and communicate in a calm and assertive manner. Your doctor may also recommend therapy or medication.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Moderate Anger Issues:</b> 
            <br/>Moderate anger is like a gust of wind. You might struggle with anger more frequently, and it might start to affect your daily life. But don't worry, help is available. A mental health professional can help you with therapy, medication, or a combination of both.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Severe Anger Issues:</b> 
            <br/>Severe anger is like a full-blown storm. You might struggle with anger all the time, and it might interfere with your relationships and daily life. If this is the case, it's important to reach out for help immediately. A mental health professional can help you get back on track with therapy, medication, or a combination of both.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>
        It's important to remember that online assessments and tests are just tools to help you understand where you stand. They're not a substitute for professional evaluation and treatment. If you're struggling with anger, it's important to talk to a mental health professional. They can give you a full evaluation and help you figure out the best way to feel better.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So there you have it, a quick rundown on anger and the different levels of severity. Remember, you're not alone and there's help available. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need it. Stay calm and carry on!

       <br/>Here are a few things you can do to tackle your problems :)
             
    <p>
       <h4>Do:</h4>
       -Try to recognise when you start to feel angry so you can take steps to calm down as early as possible
       <br/>-Give yourself time to think before reacting – try counting to 10 and doing calming breathing exercises
       <br/>-Talk to people about what's making you angry – speak to someone who is not connected to the situation, such as a friend, a GP or a support group such as Samaritans
       <br/>-Exercise – activities such as running, walking, swimming and yoga can help you relax and reduce stress
       <br/>-Find out how to raise your self-esteem, including how to be more assertive
       <br/>-Consider peer support, where people use their experiences to help others. Find out more about peer support on the Mind website
       <br/>-Listen to free mental wellbeing audio guides
       <br/>-Try self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques on the Every Mind Matters website to manage unhelpful thoughts, reframe situations, solve problems and deal with stress
       
       <h4>Don't:</h4>
       do not try to do everything at once; set small targets you can easily achieve
        <br/>do not focus on things you cannot change. Focus your time and energy on helping yourself feel better
        <br/>try not to tell yourself that you're alone – most people feel angry sometimes and support is available
        <br/>try not to use alcohol, cigarettes, gambling or drugs to relieve anger – these can all contribute to poor mental health
