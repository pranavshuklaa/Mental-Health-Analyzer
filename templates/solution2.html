    <p>Hey there! Are you feeling a little on edge lately? Are your thoughts racing and your heart beating fast? Well, you're not alone. Anxiety affects millions of people every day. But don't worry, I'm here to help you understand what it is and what you can do about it.</p><br/>
    <!-- <h3>Depression</h3> -->
    <p>Anxiety is like having a constant worry bubble following you around. It can make you feel nervous, stressed, and just not yourself. But the good news is, there's a way to pop that worry bubble.Just like depression, there are different levels of anxiety, and it's important to know where you stand so you can take the right steps to feel better. Let's take a look at the different levels:
    </p>
    
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>No Anxiety:</b> 
            <br/>If you don't have any symptoms of anxiety, then you're in the clear!

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Mild Anxiety:</b> 
            <br/>Mild anxiety is like a light breeze. You might feel a little nervous and worried, but you're still able to get things done. To feel better, try to exercise regularly, get plenty of sleep, eat well, and reduce stress. Your doctor may also recommend therapy or medication.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Moderate Anxiety:</b> 
            <br/>Moderate anxiety is like a gust of wind. You might have a harder time getting things done, and you might feel really nervous and stressed. But don't worry, help is available. A mental health professional can help you with therapy, medication, or a combination of both.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Severe Anxiety:</b> 
            <br/> Severe anxiety is like a full-blown storm. It can be really tough to get through the day and you might even have panic attacks. If this is the case, it's important to reach out for help immediately. A mental health professional can help you get back on track with therapy, medication, or a combination of both.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p>
        
It's important to remember that online assessments and tests are just tools to help you understand where you stand. They're not a substitute for professional evaluation and treatment. If you're feeling really anxious, it's important to talk to a mental health professional. They can give you a full evaluation and help you figure out the best way to feel better.

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So there you have it, a quick rundown on anxiety and the different levels of severity. Remember, you're not alone and there's help available. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need it. Take care!

       <br/>Here are a few things you can do to tackle your problems :)
             
    <p>
       <h4>Do:</h4>
       -Try to recognise when you start to feel angry so you can take steps to calm down as early as possible
       <br/>-Give yourself time to think before reacting – try counting to 10 and doing calming breathing exercises
       <br/>-Talk to people about what's making you angry – speak to someone who is not connected to the situation, such as a friend, a GP or a support group such as Samaritans
       <br/>-Exercise – activities such as running, walking, swimming and yoga can help you relax and reduce stress
       <br/>-Find out how to raise your self-esteem, including how to be more assertive
       <br/>-Consider peer support, where people use their experiences to help others. Find out more about peer support on the Mind website
       <br/>-Listen to free mental wellbeing audio guides
       <br/>-Try self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques on the Every Mind Matters website to manage unhelpful thoughts, reframe situations, solve problems and deal with stress
       
       <h4>Don't:</h4>
       do not try to do everything at once; set small targets you can easily achieve
        <br/>do not focus on things you cannot change. Focus your time and energy on helping yourself feel better
        <br/>try not to tell yourself that you're alone – most people feel angry sometimes and support is available
        <br/>try not to use alcohol, cigarettes, gambling or drugs to relieve anger – these can all contribute to poor mental health
